The initial commit was made on **22.07.2023**

This repository contains scripts for analysis and figures of the paper **It takes two (seconds): Decreasing Encoding Time for Two-Choice FNIRS BCI Communication**.

Real-time analysis of encoded answers was performed using [TurboSatori](https://nirx.net/turbosatori).

Most figures were created using Python and Jupyter notebooks. Figure 6 was created using Matlab. All figures not included here were created manually.
